# Lab: A Static Frontend for TaskMaster

## Overview

JSON is cool and all, but humans struggle with understanding it. Letâ€™s admit our human failings by creating a web frontend with React to view this data in a more user-friendly way. ðŸ¤–

## Feature Tasks

- A user should be able to visit the homepage of your React app and see the list of all tasks available in the database.
- React should be well-factored into at least 2 components.
- The homepage should have reasonable styling and layout. (Nothing too fancy, but it shouldnâ€™t make the user cringe.)
- A user should be able to find that homepage on the Internet, deployed as a static site using S3.

## Deployment

- [S3](http://taskmaster-frontend.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com)
- [Backend](http://taskmaster-dev-1.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/api/v1/tasks)
